# Binary-Search-Tree
Binary Search Tree
Binary Search Trees
Details

For this assignment you will be developing a C++ program which implements a binary search tree. Your program will read in a text file called cmd.txt that will tell your program what operations to run. Your program will take this file as a command line argument. Your program should implement a C++ class which will be used to represent your binary search tree. This repo contains the following directories:

    src - Contains the source code for the assignment and the files you will need to complete. Any modifications you make to complete your assignment should be made inside this directory.
    tests - This directory contains the code that is used to test your program. You should not modify any code inside of this directory as it could give you incorrect results. The code in this directory can be compiled and executed when you beleive your assignment is complete.

Files

Inside of the src directory you will find the following files

    main.cpp - This file is the driver of your program. It creates an instance of your class and then performs various operations that your class implements. It reads information from cmd.txt which instructions the program on what actions to take. This file has already been completed for you and should not be modified.
    node.hpp - This file defines and implements the Node class which is the basic building block used to create our data structure. This file has already been completed and should not be modified. Be sure to review the functions that this class implements.
    bst.hpp - This file defines and implements the BST class. You are responsible for implementing all functions of this class as they are shown in the class prototype at the top of the .hpp file.
    makefile - This is the file that can be used to build your program. This file has already been completed and should not be modified.
    cmd.txt - This file is a sample cmd file that can be used to test your program's functionality. You may use it as is or add or change values in order to test different edge cases.

In short, the following files are the only ones that you should modify for this assignment:

    bst.hpp
    cmd.txt

No other file should be modified!
Interface

Below is the prototype for the class you are to implement. It can also be found in the .hpp file for the class. If you have any questions as to the expected behavior of a function please do not hesitate to ask

template<class T>
class BST{
public:
    // Constructor for the BST class, creates an empty tree
    BST(void);
    // Destructor for the BST class, destroys the tree
    ~BST(void);
    // Inserts data into the tree
    // param: The data to be inserted into the tree
    void insert(T);
    // Removes data from the tree
    // param: The data to be removed from the tree
    void remove(T);
    // Performs an inorder traversal
    // returns: pointer to a vector containing the tree traversal
    std::vector<T> *inorder(void);
    // Performs an postorder traversal
    // returns: pointer to a vector containing the tree traversal
    std::vector<T> *postorder(void);
    // Performs an preorder traversal
    // returns: pointer to a vector containing the tree traversal
    std::vector<T> *preorder(void);
    // Searches the tree for a given value
    // param: the data to search for
    // returns: a pointer to the node containing the data or NULL if the data
    //          was not found
    Node<T> *search(T);
    // Gets the current number of nodes in the tree
    // returns: the number of nodes in the tree
    int get_size(void);
};

cmd File Format

The cmd file for this assignment consists of two columns of numbers. The first column indications the function that should be called, and the second column indications the operand that that function may take. If the function takes no operand then the entry will be blank. The first column number to function mapping is as follows

1   insert
2   remove
3   inorder
4   postorder
5   pre order
6   search
7   get_size

The path to the command file will be read in from the command line. The name of the file should NOT be hardcoded into your program.
Building Your Program

GNU Make is used to build our program for us. To support that a complete make file has already been provided for you. In order to build your program perform the following steps:

    cd into the source director cd src
    Type make to build your program.

Runing unit tests

The unit tests that will be used to grade your program have already been included in this repo. If you beleive your program to be functioning correctly you may run them localy in order to verify your programs correctness. To run them, first cd into the tests directory. Then type make which will build the unit tests for your program, this may take a minute as multiple executables are being compiled. Then finally type ./run_tests.sh to execute the unit tests and report back if they passed or failed.
Deliverables

Commit the final version of your code and push it to the github repository before the due date of the assignment
Expections

    Your code should build and run, no points will be awarded to code that does not compile
    No use of any prebuilt tree libraries
    Your code should be well formatted, points may be taken for sloppy code
    Your output should match the output provided in output.txt
    Your code should be fairly robust and be able to handle obvious edge cases such as searching for a number which is not in the tree.
    Passing all unit tests does not gaurentee you will be awarded full points for assignment. Points may be deducted for poor coding practices, unresolved compilation warnings, poor formatting, or other syntax or semantic errors

Special behavior

There is a unique case to think about when dealing with a BST. That is what happens if we try to insert a number that is already in the tree into the tree again? It is expected that only one occurance of a number or node should ever appear in a tree, so if you ever try to insert the same node into a tree twice then your program should not insert the duplicate node into the tree.
